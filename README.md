**Objective:** Learn how to load an image from your computer and display it using OpenCV and Matplotlib.

**Steps:**
1. Load an image using OpenCV.
2. Display the image using OpenCV.
3. Convert the image from BGR to RGB format for compatibility with Matplotlib.
4. Display the image using Matplotlib.

### Project 2: Grayscale Conversion

**Objective:** Convert a color image to grayscale and display it.

**Steps:**
1. Convert the loaded color image to grayscale using OpenCV.
2. Display the grayscale image using Matplotlib.

### Project 3: Image Resizing

**Objective:** Resize an image to a different width and height.

**Steps:**
1. Resize the loaded image to the desired dimensions using OpenCV.
2. Display the resized image using Matplotlib.
